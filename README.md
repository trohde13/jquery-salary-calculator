# SALARY CALCULATOR

## Description

_Duration: 48 Hours_

This is a Salary Calculator class project completed during a weekend project sprint. The base functionality of the calculator allows employee inputs for First Name, Last Name, Job Title, Employee ID, and Annual Salary. These inputs are added to a table, and as they are added, the annual salaries are calculated out to display the total monthly costs associated with the employees below the table. If the costs are larger than a particular threshold (in this case, $20000 for the month) then the total monthly cost displayed will be highlighted red to draw attention to it.
